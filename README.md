# web3-crowdfunding

trusted crowdfunding platform using a smart contract 


as per trusted reports 85% of the startups delay the delivery and 14% of them don't deliver at all what was promised  to angel investors

as of today many crowdfunding platforms have accountability and trust problems  and 
that's why in many cases money from investors has gone into wrong campaign and has been misused

now here by implementing a blockchain-based platform one can bring in a great change in this scenario with blockchain technology 
investors can know to whom the money is going and 
how they are spending it a smart contract helps to block the funds within the blockchain until the project or a startup founder makes progress in the project
